## Extended Piecewise Algorithm Implementation

InterPSS[5] has open and flexible architecture. InterPSS power network model has been extended in a Hybrid-Simulation project led by ASU to implement the extended piecewise algorithm. It is our intention to refactor the extended piecewise algorithm implementation contributed by the Hybrid-Simulation project and make it available to the power engineering community, including higher level of abstraction, intuitive and easy-to-use programming API, detailed documentation, tutorial material and sample test cases. The primary goal of the open implementation is to make future InterPSS core library based Hybrid-Simulation-like project implementations more straight-forward, see [Open Implementation of Extended Piecewise Algorithm] (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k12m7XfWMUK-CufGc-7HwMlUQ7q6V26pAOIIyQ3WH2c/edit#) for more details.
